        <h1>UV Camera Help</h1>
            <div>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#main">Main Menu</a></li>
                <li><a href="#camera">Camera Screen</a></li>
                <li><a href="#photos">Photo Access</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id="main">Main Menu</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The main screen offers three options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press "Start" to enter the <a href="#camera">camera</a> view.</li>
                <li>Use the on/off switch to enable or disable "debug" mode, in which 
                    the image processing sequence is made visible by saving each step
                    of the processing pipeline as a separate image (currently 8 images
                    saved for each photograph taken).</li>
                <li>Click "Help" to view this webpage.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h1 id="camera">Camera Screen</h1>
        <div>
            <p>By default, the camera screen will show a live video "preview" using the NFOV
            VIS camera.</p>

            <p>To take an image, click the round circle button ‚ö´Ô∏è at the bottom of the screen.
            You will hear <b>two</b> clicks, as both the NFOV and WFOV take photos in turn.</p>

            <p>You will then see a processed UV-enhanced image thumbnail in the upper-left corner
            of the screen.  If you wish, you can now switch to the standard iPhone "Photos" app
            and examine that image in detail, or download it from the phone to your computer
            using any <a href="#photos">standard protocol</a>.</p>

            <p>You can also click the üîÅ  icon to swap the "Picture-in-Picture" thumbnail with the
            live preview, if you prefer that arrangement.</p>
        </div>

        <h1 id="photos">Photo Access</h1>
        <div>
            <p>To remove your saved images, use the standard "Photos" app that comes with your
            iPhone.  This allows you to download photos to a PC using USB, send them via email,
            or share them to Facebook, Instagram etc.</p>
