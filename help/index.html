        <h1>UV Camera Help</h1>
            <div>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#main">Main Menu</a></li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id="main">Main Menu</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The main screen offers three options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press "Start" to enter the <a href="#camera">camera</a> view.</li>
                <li>Use the on/off switch to enable or disable "debug" mode, in which 
                    the image processing sequence is made visible by saving each step
                    of the processing pipeline as a separate image (currently ~30 images
                    are saved for each photograph taken).</li>
                <li>Click "Help" to view this webpage.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h1 id="camera">Camera Screen</h1>
        <div>
            <p>By default, the camera screen will show a live video "preview" using the NFOV
            VIS camera.</p>

            <p>To take an image, click the round circle button ‚ö´Ô∏è at the bottom of the screen.
            You will hear <b>two</b> clicks, as both the NFOV and WFOV take photos in turn.</p>

            <p>You will then see a processed UV-enhanced image thumbnail in the upper-left corner
            of the screen.  If you wish, you can now switch to the standard iPhone "Photos" app
            and examine that image in detail, or download it from the phone to your computer
            using any <a href="#photos">standard protocol</a>.</p>

            <p>You can also click the üîÅ  icon to swap the "Picture-in-Picture" thumbnail with the
            live preview, if you prefer that arrangement.</p>
        </div>

        <h1 id="photos">Photo Access</h1>
        <div>
            <p>To remove your saved images, use the standard "Photos" app that comes with your
            iPhone.  This allows you to download photos to a PC using USB, send them via email,
            or share them to Facebook, Instagram etc.</p>
        </div>

        <h1 id="load">Loading Saved Photos</h1>
        <div>
            <p>While on the camera screen, instead of taking new photos, you can
            also load earlier "raw" images for re-processing.  This allows developers
            to test new processing steps and parameters against old input data to see
            whether and how they improve the output result. This also allows new users
            to experiment with the program and see how it processes data even when they
            don't have a suitable UV sample at hand for live testing.</p>

            <p>Note that you will be prompted to select TWO photos: both the unfiltered
            WFOV image, and the filtered NFOV image, which will normally be in immediate
            sequential order (they should have been saved at the same time, right after
            each other, when recorded by the software).</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Press the "Load" link at the bottom of the camera view, just below
                    the "photo" button.</li>
                <li>You will be shown the phone's photo gallery.  Scroll to and select the
                    UNFILTERED (WFOV) image you wish to re-process.</li>
                <li>You will then be re-shown the same photo gallery.  Scroll to and select
                    the FILTERED (NFOV) image you wish to re-process, which will normally be
                    the blurry, discoloured image immediately AFTER the unfiltered image you
                    previously chose.</li>
                <li>The software will then re-process the loaded files and display (and save) 
                    the re-processed image.  If "Save image components" is selected, all
                    intermediate work artifacts involved in the processing will be saved as 
                    well.</li>
            </ol>
